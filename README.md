# Banking-Data-Insights-Credit-Product-Case-Study
Analyze account, customer, and transactional data to produce a business case for a new banking product.

🔍 Project Overview

This case study uses three datasets:

Customer

Account

Transaction

The goal is to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data to answer business-driven questions and build an executive-level recommendation for launching a new credit product.

🧠 Key Analysis Areas
1. SQL Data Manipulation

Using SQL, the project answers operational analytics questions such as:

Which branch has the most customers?

Age of the oldest customer

Number of accounts held by the oldest customer

Number of Starbucks transactions in April

Total Starbucks spend in April

Hypothesis test: Is the average Starbucks spend different between April and June?

Calculating a 10-period moving average to detect abnormal spending spikes

These queries demonstrate joins, aggregations, date functions, filtering, window logic, and statistical reasoning.

2. Customer Segmentation

Created meaningful customer segments based on:

Income level

Spending behavior

Merchant category preferences

Account activity patterns

Segmentation was used to identify which group would be the highest-value target for a new financial product.

3. Business Case Recommendation

Delivered an executive-style proposal that includes:

A clear product focus (specific merchant category)

Data-driven rationale

Customer segment selection

Risks and challenges

Expected business impact
